# 101 DALMATIANS: ARRAY METHOD PRACTICE

In the attached data.js file, there is a list of all 101 Dalmatians. For each dalmatian, you'll find a corresponding object in the array with the following information:

`const dog = { "name": 'Pongo', "age": 3, "spots": 35, "height": 15, "weight": 24 };`

This repo contains practice problems for the .map(), .reduce(), .forEach(), and .filter() array methods. **If you want to tackle the challenges by method, start in `sorted.js`. If you want to work on them in a random order, start in `random.js`.**

If you still want more practice after you complete the exercises, challenge yourself to re-solve each problem using a different Array method.
