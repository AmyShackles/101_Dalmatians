# 101 DALMATIANS: ARRAY METHOD PRACTICE

In the attached data.js file, there is a list of all 101 Dalmatians. For each dalmatian, you'll find a corresponding object in the array with the following information:

`const dog = { "name": 'Pongo', "age": 3, "spots": 35, "height": 15, "weight": 24 };`

This repo contains practice problems for the .map(), .reduce(), .forEach(), and .filter() array methods. You can approach this problem set in a categorical way (all the .map() problems, then .reduce(), etc), or you can approach them in a random order (forcing you to decide which method to apply in each case).

Remember: these four methods are different ways of doing the same basic thing: looping through an array and doing something with each element, one by one. After you complete the exercises, challenge yourself to re-solve each problem using a different Array method.
